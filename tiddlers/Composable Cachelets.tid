!!! Cache:

Divided into several cache lines, common size is 64 byte.

Address mapping: from virtual address to linear address to physical address

!!! Composable Cachelets (CC):



<img ></img>
Aiming at tracking the allocation of cachelets to various enclaves, CC assigns each physical cachelet a unique cachelet identifier comprised of the cachelet’s set and way offsets within the cache.

CFL: cachelet free list, a FIFO-like structure analogous to the free list in register renaming schemes

VPT: virtual partition table, which holds a cachelet identifier entry for each cachelet allocated to the running enclave (a)



CC intercepts memory accesses from enclaves and remaps them to cachelets defined in the enclave's VPT. The remapping logic masks the address so that it indexes to a cachelet set (b).
